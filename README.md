# Healthcare Monitor System

## Project Overview
The **Healthcare Monitor System** is a Python-based application designed to monitor patient health parameters in real time. The system processes health-related data, evaluates it against predefined safety thresholds, and identifies abnormal conditions to support timely healthcare decision-making.

This project demonstrates the use of software-based monitoring logic for smart healthcare and patient observation systems.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:
- Continuously monitor healthcare parameters
- Detect abnormal or critical health conditions
- Provide timely alerts and status updates
- Support efficient and reliable healthcare monitoring workflows

---

## System Workflow
1. Health parameters are collected from input sources or simulated data.
2. Input data is validated and preprocessed to ensure correctness.
3. Each parameter is evaluated using threshold-based logic.
4. Normal and abnormal conditions are identified.
5. Alerts or status messages are generated for critical conditions.
6. Results are displayed for monitoring and review.

---

## Technical Implementation
The system is implemented using **Python**, following a modular and structured approach. Threshold-based decision logic is used to compare real-time values against safe limits. The program ensures clarity, reliability, and ease of future enhancement through organized control flow and error handling.
